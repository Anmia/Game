pet project

This is a pet project and I am still learning the ropes.
I am trying to do as much I can from scratch.
As such I am taking this semi-seriously.

The premise is DnD based combat set in a short adventure (or longer if i can be 
bothered).
I know that in basing the combat, and everything else, on DnD I risk making it 
so that there is a probability that I will never complete the game.

I will be adding story as I go along. I wrote it myself so, if you are following, 
don't expect too much (trying to be optimistic here!)

For now it is essentially a text adventure, but a graphical interface might become 
a thing one day. Possibly using JavaFX

A save function might also one day be a thing, but who knows.
(I know how to do it in theory with PHP and SQL, but not with Java)

This game borrows inspiration from D&D and a game I sadly cannot remember the 
name of. 

There is UML for this, if you were wondering, and it is only slightly less messy 
at the moment of writing

---- INSTRUCTION ----

To play the game only a numpad is required. The numbers row can be used, but 
using the numpad is recommended as it will make the game easier to play. 

---- ERROR CODES ----

010: Please consult Oracle Customer Support as, regrettably, a if-statement has 
malfunctioned and the else did not kick in. (Also aplies to switch)
