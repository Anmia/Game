pet project

This is a pet project and I am still learning the ropes.
I am trying to do as much I can from scratch.

The premise is DnD based combat set in a short adventure (or longer if i can be bothered).
I know that in basing the combat, and everything else, on DnD I risk making it so that there is a probability that I will never complete the game.

I will be adding story as I go along. I wrote it myself so, if you are following, don't expect too much (trying to be optimistic here!)

For now it is esentialy a text adventure, but a graphical interface might become a thing one day. Posibly using JavaFX

A save function might also one day be a thing, but who knows.
(I know how to do it in theory with PHP and SQL, but not with Java)

This game borrows inspiration from D&D and a game I sadly cannot remember the name of. 

There is UML for this, if you were wondering, and it is only slightly less messy at the moment of writing
