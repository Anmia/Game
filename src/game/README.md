pet project

This is a pet project and I am still learning the ropes.
I am trying to do as much I can from scratch.

The premise is DnD based combat set in a short adventure (or longer if i can be bothered).
I know that in basing the combat, and everything else, on DnD I risk making it so that there is a probability that I will never complete the game.

I will be adding story as I go along. I wrote it myself so, if you are following, don't expect too much (trying to be optimistic here!)

For now it is esentialy a text adventure, but a graphical interface might become a thing one day. Posibly using JavaFX

A save function might also one day be a thing, but who knows.
(I know how to do it in theory with PHP and SQL, but not with Java)

This game borrows inspiration from D&D and a game I sadly cannot remember the name of. 

There is UML for this, if you were wondering, and it is only slightly less messy at the moment of writing

Some commits contain comments which are done semi properly. 
If there is a to do list there are several categories, which at present are:

"This will need a lot of time" = I'm working on it by working on other things.

Bonus = Will be worked out while working on other things

Streamline = Might do it, as it will make the game better, but unable to do it 
due to lack of skill and/or knowledge of how to do it
